This organization holds early [explainers](https://tag.w3.org/explainers/) for changes to the web
platform that are being developed by teams within Google. These explainers are invitations for
feedback. They start out by roughly describing a problem that users face on the web and possibly a
sketch of one or more designs that might solve that problem. We expect both the problem statement
and solutions to change, sometimes dramatically, in response to feedback. As an explainer matures,
and more people and organizations agree with the problem statement, we also expect to transfer its
repository to an "incubation venue" like a [W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/). If
a team decides to stop working on an explainer, we'll archive its repository instead.

Note that Google contains many teams, and the fact that one team is proposing a change doesn't mean
either that every team agrees with the change or that the change will be accepted by the [Blink
launch process](https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features/).

# For Googlers

If you need to publish a new explainer, see
[go/create-web-platform-explainer](https://goto.google.com/create-web-platform-explainer) for
instructions.
